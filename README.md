# DS-Survey
Data Cleaning and Insight Generation From Survey Data

# Data Science Survey Dashboard  

A Data Cleaning and Insight Generation Project.

This project was an interactive data analytics project built with **Python** (for cleaning and preprocessing) and **Excel** (for dashboard visualization). The dataset is based on a Data Science survey (2017–2021) and showcases insights into demographics, education, job roles, experience, and tool usage among professionals.

## 📊 Features  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Python (pandas, numpy).  
- Encoded categorical variables for dashboard readiness.  
- Excel dashboard with:  
  - KPIs (Total Respondents, Avg. Experience, Top Job Role, Most Common Education).  
  - Pivot table insights.  
  - Interactive slicers (Age, Gender, Country, Education).  
  - Visualizations (bar chart, line chart).
